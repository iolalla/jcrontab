<h2>General Information</h2>



Jcrontab is a scheduler  written in Java. The project objective is to 
provide a fully functional system to execute classes at a given time
 in Java projects.</p>

Provides a system to run Classes/Threads/main/EJB/Methods/... at a given time.</p>
Provides a parser of crontab-like files that are fully compatible with 
UNIX-POSIX crontab files.</p>
Stores and reads crontab table from files, DD.BB. and is designed to be 
extended using generic interface DataSource to store/read crontab from any place.</p>
Sends an email with the result of the execution.</p>
Can be easily integrated with application servers - it has been tested in 
Tomcat, Resin, Jetty and Jboss. It has a load-on-startup servlet to make it easier.</p>
Can be used as a stand-alone application to "replace" cron.</p>
Has been designed and developed to get maximum performance and extensibility.</p>

Q:How can i use jcrontab with tomcat?

A:	This is a receipt usefull with any app-server that supports servlets. You 
have to use org.jcrontab.web.loadCrontabServlet and set this servlet as a load
on startup Servlet.
	Ususally this is done with:
	
	<!-- This is the loadOnStartupServlet in order to launch jcrontab with the 
		application server -->
	<servlet>
		<servlet-name>LoadOnStartupServlet</servlet-name>
		<servlet-class>org.jcrontab.web.loadCrontabServlet</servlet-class>
		<load-on-startup>1</load-on-startup>
	</servlet>
	<!-- Mapping of the StartUp Servlet -->
	<servlet-mapping>
		<servlet-name>LoadOnStartupServlet</servlet-name>
		<url-pattern>/Startup</url-pattern>
	</servlet-mapping>

	If you have your load-on-startup in your system and don't want to use jcrontab
one you can copy directly from loadCrontabServlet.java in this file you'll see 
how jcrontab can be initialized.
	
	This have been tested in:
	- resin-caucho(2.0.2), jakarta-tomcat(3.2, 3.3, 4.0.1), jetty(4.0D1), ... 
send your tests.

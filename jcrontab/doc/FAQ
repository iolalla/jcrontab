Q:How can i use jcrontab with tomcat?

A:	This is a receipt usefull with any app-server that supports servlets. You 
have to use org.jcrontab.web.loadCrontabServlet and set this servlet as a load
on startup Servlet.
	Ususally this is done with:
	
	<!-- This is the loadOnStartupServlet in order to launch jcrontab with the 
		application server -->
	<servlet>
		<servlet-name>LoadOnStartupServlet</servlet-name>
		<servlet-class>org.jcrontab.web.loadCrontabServlet</servlet-class>
		<load-on-startup>1</load-on-startup>
	</servlet>
	<!-- Mapping of the StartUp Servlet -->
	<servlet-mapping>
		<servlet-name>LoadOnStartupServlet</servlet-name>
		<url-pattern>/Startup</url-pattern>
	</servlet-mapping>

	If you have your load-on-startup in your system and don't want to use jcrontab
one you can copy directly from loadCrontabServlet.java in this file you'll see 
how jcrontab can be initialized.
	
	This have been tested in:
	- resin-caucho(2.0.2), jakarta-tomcat(3.2, 3.3, 4.0.1), jetty(4.0D1), ... 
send your tests.

Q:How can i change the events.cfg to any other file/path?

Q:How can i launch a native program with jcrontab?

A:Assuming we are talking about anything you can launch from your console and we are 
not talking about programs with user interaction (i.e.:most "windows" programs, 
write your password). It's quite easy you have two options write your own wrapper and
launch this one, if you want to see an example can take a look at src/org/jcrontab/
nativeExec.java. This example explains howto get input from the program, error and 
howto pass parameters.
If you don't want to write your own wrapper can use org.jcrontab.nativeExec as the task
and pass the name of the program you want to launch as parameters.i.e.:
* * * * * org.jcrontab.nativeExec ls -la 
will launch native ls -la every minute of every hour.
And that's it. You can launch more or less everything with jcrontab.

Q: When i launch a script (sh/perl/php/bsh) with NativeExec it doesn't work why?

A: Usually this is caused cause NativeExec doesn't know how to find the interpreter, try
passing the interpreter. 

* * * * * org.jcrontab.NativeExec sh yourScript.sh
or 
* * * * * org.jcrontab.NativeExec perl theScript.pl

Q: How can i emmbed in jcrontab in my application?

A: This can be easilly done use org.jcrontab.jcrontab to find inspiration.
But basically you have to get the system Crontab, init and the just wait for
Crontab to do the job. 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
private Crontab crontab = Crontab.getInstance();
crontab.init("yourPropertiesFile", 60);
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
crontab.init() does it job and starts the Cron Thread.

<p>
	Jcrontab includes a class to invoke native programs, this means programs 
	written in other languages than java. This class invokes the program calling 
	the Runtime.exec() method and controlling the output via the Process.getInputStream()
	and the Process.getErrorStream(). To call a native program use org.jcrontab.NativeExec
	and pass the native program as argument. Rememeber about the path, the path 
	your program is invoked is the same as the java program started.
	Usually is very usefull to wrap the native program with a shell script or a 
	batch commands file. To prepare the environment of the execution.

	p.e.:
	org.jcrontab.tests.TaskTest2 --> will invoke the main method of this class.
										If fail -: for Runnable : org.jcrontab.tests.TaskTest2.run() .
	org.jcrontab.tests.TaskTest2#testMethod --> will invoke <b>testMethod</b> method of the class.
	org.jcrontab.tests.TaskTest2#testMethod : here is text at ExtrainfoCol --> will invoke 
										a) static org.jcrontab.tests.TaskTest2.<b>testMethod</b>(new String[]{"here","is","text","at","ExtrainfoCol"}) method of the class. 
										b) If fail -: static org.jcrontab.tests.TaskTest2.<b>testMethod</b>("here") . 
										d) If fail -: for Runnable : org.jcrontab.tests.TaskTest2.run() .
										c) If fail -: prev case.

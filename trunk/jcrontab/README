COMPILATION:
    
    Jcrontab includes various modules:
    Web
    DataSource
    Tests
    And in order to build those you need external packages:
    
    Web:
    - servlet.jar
    - xalan.jar
    - xerces.jar
    DataSource:
    - postgresql.jar
    Tests:

    If you want to use ant to get the job done you should download first those 
packages and put them into jar/ directory.
    
    Otherwise you can compile with javac with smth like
    $cd src/
    $javac -classpath yourselection.jar org/jcrontab/*.java

    And that's all you need to get jcrontab compile and running

Hi,

Yes in fact what Cron does is to rebuild the tasks list every minute. this is the reason of the activity. If you want to change this delay you can do it changing "minute" variable at Cron.java to whatever you need. In a near future Cron will support variables to change this kind of stuff.

Finish is a method to let the classes that extend this to overwrite it and implement in finish tasks as closing connections or cleaning files.

In Fact this method is only called if you call Crontab uninit method.

You can forget about this method cause isnt abstract... :-)

Excuseme for the dealy in the answer but i have tons of work ... :-)

If you want to take a sight in the source will see new things.... and i hope in a few days a new release :-)

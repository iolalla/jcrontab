Q:How can i use jcrontab with tomcat?

A:	This is a receipt usefull with any app-server that supports servlets. You 
have to use org.jcrontab.web.loadCrontabServlet and set this servlet as a load
on startup Servlet.
	Ususally this is done editing your web.xml:
	
	<!-- This is the loadOnStartupServlet in order to launch jcrontab with the 
		application server -->
	<servlet>
		<servlet-name>LoadOnStartupServlet</servlet-name>
		<servlet-class>org.jcrontab.web.loadCrontabServlet</servlet-class>
	<!-- can overwrite the parameters from jcrontab.properties -->
	<!-- simply adding here the right parameters -->
        <init-param>
            <param-name>org.jcrontab.data.file</param-name>
            <param-value>$HOME/.jcrontab/thisfileoverwritesjcrontab.properties</param-value>
        </init-param>
		<load-on-startup>1</load-on-startup>
	</servlet>
	<!-- Mapping of the StartUp Servlet -->
	<servlet-mapping>
		<servlet-name>LoadOnStartupServlet</servlet-name>
		<url-pattern>/Startup</url-pattern>
	</servlet-mapping>

	If you have your load-on-startup in your system and don't want to use jcrontab
one you can copy directly from loadCrontabServlet.java in this file you'll see 
how jcrontab can be initialized.
	
	This have been tested in:
	- resin-caucho(2.0.2), jakarta-tomcat(3.2, 3.3, 4.0.1), jetty(4.0D1), ... 
send your tests.

Q:How can i change the crontab to any other file/path?

A:This can be done easilly editing an changing the $HOME/.jcrontab/jcrontab.properties
file.	

Q:How can i launch a native program with jcrontab?

A:Assuming we are talking about anything you can launch from your console and we are 
not talking about programs with user interaction (i.e.:most "windows" programs, 
write your password). It's quite easy you have two options write your own wrapper and
launch this one, if you want to see an example can take a look at src/org/jcrontab/
nativeExec.java. This example explains howto get input from the program, error and 
howto pass parameters.
If you don't want to write your own wrapper can use org.jcrontab.nativeExec as the task
and pass the name of the program you want to launch as parameters.i.e.:
* * * * * org.jcrontab.nativeExec ls -la 
will launch native ls -la every minute of every hour.
And that's it. You can launch more or less everything with jcrontab.

Q: When i launch a script (sh/perl/php/bsh) with NativeExec it doesn't work why?

A: Usually this is caused cause NativeExec doesn't know how to find the interpreter, try
passing the interpreter. 

* * * * * org.jcrontab.NativeExec sh yourScript.sh
or 
* * * * * org.jcrontab.NativeExec perl theScript.pl
or
* * * * * bsh.Interpreter yourScript.bsh

Q: How can i emmbed in jcrontab in my application?

A: This can be easilly done use org.jcrontab.jcrontab to find inspiration.
But basically you have to get the system Crontab, init and the just wait for
Crontab to do the job. 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
private Crontab crontab = Crontab.getInstance();
crontab.init("yourPropertiesFile", 60);
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
crontab.init() does it job and starts the Cron Thread.

Q: How can i use SQL/DD.BB. with jcrontab?

A: You can take a look at jcrontab/etc/create.sql there is the definition of tables to 
work with jcrontab,but if you want to use other tables, 
can change src/org/jcrontab/data/GenericSQLSource.java, and adapt the querys to you tables.

          When you're done with the model and the GenericSQLSource.java, should adapt
jcrontab.properties to your needs and that's all.
p.e.:

org.jcrontab.data.datasource = org.jcrontab.data.GenericSQLSource
org.jcrontab.data.GenericSQLSource.driver = org.gjt.mm.mysql.Driver
org.jcrontab.data.GenericSQLSource.url = jdbc:mysql://yourmachine.jcrontab.org:3306/jcrontab
org.jcrontab.data.GenericSQLSource.username = iolalla
org.jcrontab.data.GenericSQLSource.password = yourpassword

	If this GenericSQLSource.java isn't enough the idea is  that a 
"org.jcrontab.data.DataSource" should give the info necesary to build a 
org.jcrontab.CrontabEntryBean.

Q: How can i get an email with each execution of a task as in Unix?

A: To do so you need to set the following parameters to the right value:

org.jcrontab.sendMail.to=iolalla@yahoo.com
org.jcrontab.sendMail.from=jcrontab@yoursystem.com
org.jcrontab.sendMail.smtp.host=smtp.yahoo.com
org.jcrontab.sendMail.smtp.user= yourSMTPusername
org.jcrontab.sendMail.smtp.password=yourSMTPpassword

	And will receive an email each time a task is executed.

Q: How can i avoid Jcrontab Log?

A:	First Option be sure the task you launch is logging where you want cause
Jcrontab does only a few logging and usually the problem is with tasks more 
than with jcrontab
	
	Second option is to write your own Logger to get the job done, take a look 
at org.jcrontab.log.Logger and add your logger to the jcrontab.properties:

org.jcrontab.log.Logger=org.jcrontab.log.YourLogger

Q: Do the classes I start must have a main method?

A:   No, the classes only should have a static method, a default constructor or extend Runnable.  I am working to do those more easy to use with a generic interface to use. 

Q: From inside an application server how can I schedule a class? 

A:   The model actually is designed to do so using CrontabEntryDAO.getInstance().add(CrontabEntryBean ceb); This will add the Task and will refresh the list of tasks.  If you want to execute only a task one time at any moment can use Crontab.newTask() method, but this method will be replaced with smth like AT to do a single execution of a Task in the near future (?¿?¿)

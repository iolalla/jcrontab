HOWTO use sourceforge && netbeans

    I've looking a few hours about how to use Netbeans and sourceforge and finally 
here is the solution:

    The idea is that you have to generate your ssh keys and upload those to sourceforge.

    What you need?
        - SSH client
            - Win32 (putty is a good option)
            - UNIX/linux (Openssh is your option)
        - CVS Client(console cvs client/ not tested)
            - Wincvs
            - UNIX/linux (CVS)
        - Sourceforge Account
            - DoitYourself :-)
            - It can work with many different systems as:
                - Savannah (GNU' sourceforge)
                - Your company'z "SourceForge Enterprise Edition"
                - Any SSH+CVS system
        - Netbeans:
            - Your favorite IDE isn't it
            - Hey! it works with Forte too

    Here is explained step by step:
    
    1- Excute ssh-keygen:
    LINUX/UNIX:
    #ssh-keygen
    This command will generate the necesary sigantures for your system. Those 
    will be saved at $HOME/.ssh/identity.pub
    win32:
    c:>puttygen.exe 
    Will show you a window and just follow the instructions. And copy the 
    result to the sourceforge page.
    
    <From_the_SourceForge_Docs>
    To avoid having to type your password every time for your CVS/SSH developer 
    account, you may upload your public key(s) here and they will be placed on 
    the CVS server in your ~/.ssh/identity.pub file.

    To generate a public key, run the program 'ssh-keygen' (or ssh-keygen1). 
    The public key will be placed at '~/.ssh/identity.pub'. Read the ssh 
    documentation for further information on sharing keys.
    </From_the_SourceForge_Docs>

	If you use the ssh package provided by sourceforge, the ssh-keygen doesn't
	work properly, but ssh uses keys generated by puttygen without problems.
	
    2-  Copy the result in your Sourceforge's personal Web page:
    
    follow those URL, from your personal page @Sourceforge:
        Personal Page.Account Preferences.Shell Account Information.Edit Keys

    Copy the result from the "keygen" into the "Authorized keys:" Area.

        The result should look smth like:
        1024 35 
        10838823654025632223395373316725638023042917037705851955563467949272222
        84084188520256297285249606096033260043138902890425913983431023080569461
        45928763175224386972881580732340640785610928607357763318997680030944733
        16465240380276054881569427929109079749734650741374791500471676522076287
        025779823323332003106453751471 iolalla@port-iolalla

    And send it to the sourceforge server. To send it you should only use 
    "update" button at the end of the page.

    Remember you gotta do that for each machine you work with
	
	And rememeber, you have to wait six hours to get the file uploaded to SF
	servers, yep its the time to play a game or watch a movie... 

    3- Test:
    Try to add/commit/update smth from your console without having to give 
    your password.
    
    The recommended way is to do checkout from console:
    cvs -z3 
    	-d:ext:developername@cvs.projectname.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/projectname 
	co modulename
    If everything is correct the cvs shouldn't ask you for password.
    
    4- Open you favorite IDE Netbeans/Forte:
    
    In Filesystems mount CVS filesystems and mount the CVS where you did checkout 
    in step 3.
    
	
    Use: CVS Command-Line Client
        As cvs executable cvs or cvs.exe
        I haven´t tested with Built-In Client but it should work.

    Remember to set Connection Method External:
        CVS_RSH=SSH
    
    If you didn't step 3 then you should set  up netbean's CVS filesystem by hand,
    that means you should configure the CVS correctly and passing those parameters:
    
    Server Name: cvs.your_project.sourceforge.net
    User Name: your_sourceforge's_username
    Repository: /cvsroot/your_project

    5- Try it:
    That's the best part, you don't have to do nothing else, just commit, 
    update, add, etc.

    Doubts:
	
	If you use windows refer to http://download.sourceforge.net/sfsetup/sfsetup
	-v1.2.zip, to get a valid ssh console client.
	
    refer to sourceforge doc
          http://sourceforge.net/docman/display_doc.php?docid=767&group_id=1
          http://sourceforge.net/docman/display_doc.php?docid=765&group_id=1#ssh-key
